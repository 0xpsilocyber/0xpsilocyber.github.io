## And So It Begins...

Welcome to my new corner of the internet! This is the official launch of my personal site, built with the power of Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages.

Here, I'll be exploring a few key topics:

*   **Cybersecurity:** Deep dives into infosec topics, security research, and industry musings.
*   **Sweet Snazzy Jams:** Sharing and discussing the music that fuels the work.
*   **Tech & Projects:** Other random tech projects or things I find interesting.

This first post is just a test to make sure everything is wired up correctly. Thanks for stopping by!
