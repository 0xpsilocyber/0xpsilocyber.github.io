## Vibes & Intros
>**The Vibe:** chill 🌱 introspective 🍄 bliss 🏵️ sensual 💃 strength 💪
**The Track:** [Hurricane](https://open.spotify.com/track/1UOetxsHH54HcvovvtPkmX?si=f2054602567a4a25)
**Artist:** Cannons

Let me just start by saying, I FUCKING LOVE this song. If you know me, you know how much I enjoy the whacky tabaccy. This track encapsulates what that means for me, relaxation, imagery, *silver-haze*. Oof, the song embodies what that means to me, to escape reality for a bit, reconcile what is causing me distress, plus, I enjoy sharing *the herb* with loved ones.

But beyond that, why this song? Well, to me the main idea behind the track is the artist is expressing how strong they feel in their own skin. How proud they are to be who they are, combined with a love of cannabis, sensuality, every-time I listen, I want to dance, smile, and in general just gas myself up. I believe that is the intent of the song, to be able to look at yourself introspectively, to *come back like a hurricane*. To not forget who you are, to enjoy the things you enjoy, to immerse yourself in the music, in life, in reality.

## Synesthesia timeeeee

> 🌈 As noted in previous articles, I have vivid synesthesia. The reason I talk, share, express myself in music so much, is because to me, music is like watching an incredible film, tasting the best dessert you can imagine, visualize otherworldly and alien imagery. Music unlocks something deep in me that speaks to my inner, higher self. 

The vibe of the track is so ethereal, cool, like -- cool in the badass sense. Like if you took Johnny Silverhand, merged his vibe into a serene dive bar or speakeasy. Loaded it with vivid psychedelic imagery, art, and threw it onto a dancefloor filled with some of the coolest people you can imagine. The song feels like an explosion of the self, it invokes strong imagery of silvers, golds, blacks, purples for me.

When I close my eyes, I can picture the band performing in a bar akin to *The Roadhouse* from *Twin Peaks*. -- As you can imagine, I'm also a Lynch head lol. --

I see the music, purple lights, a dark moody atmosphere, with *silver-haze* floating above the dance floor. Did I mention before how much I love dancing? Now granted, most of my dancing would be considered *hardcore-dancing* ala, metal. But something about dream-pop gets my body moving. It's like I can feel this song activating my nervous system in my back and sending my limbs moving, my chest up and down, and you know I'm boppin' my head.

See, that's why I love this song. It invokes such strong imagery for me, it makes me want to dance, rather, it forces my body to move in tune with the music. I can't really resist it.
> 💃 BTW, if you ever catch me anywhere with headphones in and moving my body. I can't control it man, the music just feels so damn good.

## What about the lyrics?

Lyrically, this song is rather simple, but powerful.

*Chorus*
> *Coming back like a hurricane.*
> *I'm gonna take you higher.*
> *On a cloud of silver haze.*
> *I wanna take you higher, away, away, away.*
> *Take you somewhere far away, away, away.*

Simple sure, but man do these lyrics hit when you're under the influence. Even without the influence, if you close your eyes and allow the music to feed to your soul. It can take you places higher. Higher to me is a state of consciousness. It is to go beyond your normal perception of reality. To see into the universe for what it is, a beautiful, chaotic, explosion of color, shapes, and experiences.

> *I can bring a change*
> *I can bring the thunder and the rain*
> *Everything around me*
> *Everything will rearrange.*

To me, this is all about shaping your reality. To come into your own skin, to bend reality around you to fit your mold. I'm a firm believer in that every single individual has the potential to completely mold reality to their will. Of course, not in the magickal sense (although I do have some beliefs), but rather, the belief in self. To make change around you, you must step up, take your life by the reigns, take risks, not be afraid to fail.

In the song, the artist regularly mentions *I'm coming back...* this to me means that we all fall off our paths, forget who we are, but we have the power -- like the strength of a hurricane, -- to bend reality as we see fit. We all have the **power to change**, we get to chose how we are defined, what we stand for, what we believe, and who we fight for.

> *We can blow them over*
> *We can take them out if you stay*
> *This is just a warning*
> *Nothing's standing in my way*
> *I've told you before*
> *I'm coming back like a hurricane.*

:) there it is. 

## damn, what a sick track.

Right? Yeah, I love to listen to this song under the influence. But beyond that, it hits deep on my personal beliefs. I tell people this quite frequently "The only thing stopping you is you." From my own lived experience, I have found that *I can achieve* anything I set my mind to. And I believe that is the same for all sapient beings. To be able to think, imagine, is a gift, one that should not be squandered.

🖤 ✌️ 💜
