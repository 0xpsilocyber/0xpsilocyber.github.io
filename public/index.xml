      <description>Preamble The Vibee: Hands Dirty Artist: Milk &amp;amp; Bone
Welcome, this is my first attempt at writing one of these &amp;lsquo;blogs&amp;rsquo; Lol. I tend to write how I think, speak and generally view data and information. If you know me, you know how sarcastic and melancholy I can be. I express myself heavily through music, lyrics, when I don&amp;rsquo;t have the words, music speaks on my behalf. If you&amp;rsquo;ve followed me on Twitter, Bluesky, or anything really, since I was a kid I&amp;rsquo;ve always shared music to sort of communicate my inner-world to the outside world.</description>

      <description>My path into Infosec &amp;ndash; Part 1 title: &amp;ldquo;My Path into Infosec&amp;rdquo; date: 2025-08-20T19:45:26-07:00 draft: true Greetings &amp;amp; Special Thanks ℹ️ Heads Up: I write specifically keeping editing to a minimum. There are likely spelling, grammatical mistakes. I prefer to keep my thoughts as close to raw as possible, and sometimes that means going off on tangents. Thank you for reading, if you are not dissuaded.
